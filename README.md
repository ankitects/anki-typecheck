This repo contains installable Python files from Anki's codebase. It is not
sufficient to run Anki on its own, but can be installed into your Python
environment for code completion and type checking of add-ons without having to
set up a full development environment.

For more detailed license info and the full source tree, please see

To install these files, clone the tree and then run pip3 install on the anki
and aqt .whl file matching the Anki version you wish to target.
